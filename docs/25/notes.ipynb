    "## Weak Formulation|\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical modeling of physical systems, **weak formulations** provide a powerful framework to analyze and solve partial differential equations (PDEs).\n",
    "Unlike the traditional strong (or classical) formulations, which require the solution to be differentiable and satisfy the PDE everywhere in the domain, the weak formulation relaxes these requirements.\n",
    "Instead, it ensures that the PDE holds in an **integral sense**, allowing solutions that may be less regular."

    "### Why Weak Formulations?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Broader Solution Space:**\n",
    "   Weak formulations permit solutions that are not differentiable everywhere, such as those with discontinuities or sharp gradients.\n",
    "   This is particularly useful in real-world problems, such as fluid dynamics, where solutions often exhibit such features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Natural Fit for Numerical Methods:**\n",
    "   Many numerical methods, including **finite element** and **spectral methods**, are based on weak formulations.\n",
    "   These methods approximate the solution by projecting it onto a finite-dimensional space of basis functions, ensuring that the integral form of the equation is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conservation Laws:**\n",
    "   Weak formulations often align naturally with conservation laws, as they integrate the governing equations over a control volume or domain.\n",
    "   This ensures that key physical quantities, such as mass, momentum, and energy, are preserved in the numerical approximation."
