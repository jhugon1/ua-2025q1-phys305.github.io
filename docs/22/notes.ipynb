    "1. **Continuum Hypothesis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Assumes that fluid properties such as density and velocity are continuously distributed in space.\n",
    "   This is valid when the mean free path of particles is much smaller than the characteristic length scales of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Newtonian Fluid:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Assumes that the stress tensor $\\mathbf{\\Pi}$ is linearly related to the strain rate tensor.\n",
    "   This implies that the fluid's viscosity is constant and that the relationship between shear stress and strain rate is proportional.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Assumes that the distribution function $f$ is close to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, allowing for the expansion of $f$ in terms of small deviations.\n",
    "   This ensures that macroscopic quantities like temperature and pressure are well-defined locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Negligible External Forces:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Often, body forces $\\mathbf{f}$ such as gravity are considered constant or negligible compared to other forces.\n",
    "   In cases where external forces are significant, they are incorporated explicitly into the momentum and energy equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Incompressible Flow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   For many practical applications, especially at low Mach numbers, the fluid is assumed to be incompressible ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$).\n",
